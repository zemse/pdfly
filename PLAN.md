# pdf-rs — remaining work

The build is feature-complete and tested (26 tests; whole corpus converts across all output
modes with no panics). See [README.md](./README.md) and [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for
what shipped. This file lists only what's left.

## Open (tractable)

- [ ] **Dense academic multi-column edge cases** — clean two-column pages read correctly via gutter
  detection; pages with a vertical margin stamp + an abstract that lives *inside* a column can still
  mis-order. Would need per-region column detection (recurse gutter detection into bands).
  *(Attempted: a band-recursive rewrite was prototyped but reverted — naively treating full-width
  spanners as band separators fragments full-width code listings inside two-column papers
  (`2408.02509v1`), and it gave no clear net win on the corpus. Needs validation data — see threshold
  tuning below — before re-attempting.)*
- [ ] **Threshold tuning (in progress)** — `opendataloader-bench` (200 PDFs w/ ground truth) is
  cloned at `../opendataloader-bench`; scoring harness wired up (see memory `opendataloader-bench-setup`).
  Baseline overall 0.717 → **0.766** so far (NID 0.847→0.860, TEDS 0.309→0.378, MHS 0.501→0.635) via:
  numbered section headings no longer eaten as lists; borderless table detection on by default with
  precision guards (fill/regularity + prose-cell + ToC rejection). Remaining: TEDS still 0.378 (12 of
  42 table docs still score 0 — borderless tables not yet detected), MHS 0.635 (< 0.74 threshold).
  Also unblocks validating the multi-column rework above.

## Blocked in this environment (need external assets)

- [ ] **Non-Latin OCR** — the OCR path works end-to-end (`--features ocr`), but the bundled `ocrs`
  models are Latin-script. Validate with language-specific `.rten` models for CJK/etc.
- [ ] **LaTeX formula extraction** — needs a local image→LaTeX vision model (e.g. pix2tex via
  `rten`). Feature scaffolding only; no model available here to build/verify against.
- [ ] **Chart / image descriptions** — needs a local VLM. Same constraint.
- [ ] **Korean special-form tables** — niche heuristic; no Korean test PDF available to verify
  against, so deliberately not implemented blind.

## Explicitly NOT doing

- Hybrid AI HTTP server (external server + network — breaks the self-contained local binary).

### Done in the latest pass (for reference)
Type1 (`/FontFile`) built-in `/Encoding` parser — symbolic Type1 fonts with a non-standard encoding
and no `/ToUnicode` now decode (verified on `1901.03003`: `†`, `‡`, `{ }`, `−`, `·` etc. recovered) ·
`--timing` flag (pages/sec per file + overall).

Earlier: tagged-PDF `/ParentTree` + PDF/UA metadata · table figure-vs-table discrimination · ToUnicode
CMap tokenizer fix (packed hex) · two-column gutter reading order · OCR end-to-end validation · publish
prep (Cargo metadata, MIT LICENSE, include whitelist) · span inference, borderless tables, glyph-name
expansion, tagged-PDF MCID association.
